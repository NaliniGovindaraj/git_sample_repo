I have planted a Gulmohar tree in the courtyard!

Papa had brought
it little on my birthday,
I had fed
him water and manure fiercely.

Now
it has become bigger than me, see it in a hurry!

With great pleasure now I
can climb on its branches , I can read for
hours and hours in its cool
shade.

If I want,
I can swing its swing in my arms in Sawan!
